### How pagination in 3 screens works at shop page  ?
I collect all numbers that control in the carousel in state of array and setState in every screen
 * pc screen :  setScreenLmts([3, 8, 3, 4, 0])
 * tab screen : setScreenLmts([2, 6, 2, 3, 0])
 * phone screen :  setScreenLmts([1, 4, 1, 2, 0])
          
screenLmts       | Explanation
-------------    | -------------
screenLmts[0,2]  | number of items in one slide - 1
screenLmts[1]    | number of items in one slide * 2
screenLmts[3]    | number of items in one slide 
screenLmts[4]    | index of 1st item in list as all
